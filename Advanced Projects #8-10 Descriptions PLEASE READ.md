# Solamon-Portfolio-Projects - Advanced Projects #8, #9, and #10

In these three advanced projects, I will demonstrate my ability to build semantic models in the Power Platform that provide valuable characterizations of operational and financial data.

### **Project List:**

  - [**Project #5:** Projected Ship Dates in the Power Platform](https://github.com/gsolamon/Solamon-Portfolio-Projects/tree/a4df116b6ae961cccb0e23dae92cdcf23fd586f1/Advanced%20Project%20%235%3A%20Projected%20Ship%20Dates%20in%20Power%20BI)

### **Project Summaries:**

  **Advanced Project #8: Customizing D365 Business Central with VSCode**
  
  1. I learned the basics of customizing our D365 Business Central (BC) environments by using Hougaard's [Simple Object Designer](https://www.hougaard.com/designer/). This tools allows us to create new fields, expose fields as APIs for Power BI, and add our custom fields to pages/reports without maintaining a code library.
  2. I used the Simple Object Designer along with Hougaard's extensive [YouTube library](https://www.youtube.com/c/ErikHougaard) of Business Central developer videos as a stepping stone to publishing customizations to Business Central using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (VSCode).
